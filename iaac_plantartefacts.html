        <h1></h1>
        <h2>What if growing plants became part of our daily urban life?</h2>
        <h4>plant wearables</h4>
        <h4>2021</h4>

        <h3>context</h3>
        To explore the role of prototyping as “a research archetype", I wanted to use it to explore the new narratives for the cities by creating artefacts to make nature visible in the city. I imagined a collection of unusual spaces to grow plants and make them visible in the city: a seed wallet to make seed exchange a normal habit, a vest to wear on top of your clothes with spaces to grow plants or carry seeds around… The 3 prototypes below all question the link we maintain with nature in our urban environment.


        <h3>bike planter</h3>
        As my bike is my main means of transportation in the city, I created an artefact to grow food on my bike and carry it around with me everywhere I go. What if we had to think and take care of nature at any time of the day?

        <h3>seed wallet</h3>
        What if we all carried seeds in a wallet in our bags and were able to exchange them freely? I sewed this transparent wallet to open the conversation around seed monopolies preventing farmers from using the seeds they want. Big corporations are today controlling what seeds can be used and how, and consequently many crop varieties have now disappeared.

        <h3>plant vest</h3>
        The last object added to this collection is a vest I sewed from a transparent plastic tablecloth with pockets on the front in which I have put soil and seedlings I was growing on my balcony. It has pockets everywhere so it could also be a way to carry small gardening tools. What if we were constantly wearing this extra layer of “nature”? What if “farming” was an activity everyone includes in their daily lives regardless of their area of activity?
